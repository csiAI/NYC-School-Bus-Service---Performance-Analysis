Summary:

This analysis of NYC School Bus Service performance reveals significant challenges in service reliability and efficiency. Key findings include high delay frequencies, substantial accumulated delay times, and notable mechanical issues across bus companies. 

KPIs & Insights:

    Average Delay Time: 37 minutes.
    
    
    Delay Frequency:

      Highest in 16-30 min range (80K occurrences)
      31-45 min delays also frequent (75K occurrences)
      Most delays fall in the 16-45 minute range, suggesting systemic issues beyond occasional traffic.

    Delay Causes:

      Heavy Traffic: 67%
      Mechanical Problems: 6%


    Accumulated Delay Times:
    
      Peak in 2022 (1025 days), declining to 303 days in 2023
      While improving, accumulated delays remain significant.
      Geographic Impact:

      Manhattan (771 days) and Brooklyn (612 days) most affected
      Focus on these boroughs could yield the highest impact.


    Mechanical Issues:

      Top 2 companies: BORO TRANS (3935 incidents) PRIDE TRANS (3105 incidents).
      Theses companies require immediate attention for fleet maintenance.


    Day of Week Performance:

      Mondays show highest breakdown rate (22.7%)
      Gradual improvement through the week
      Enhanced preparation for Monday operations could improve weekly performance.



Recommendations:

    Traffic Management:

      Collaborate with city traffic department to optimize bus routes.
      Implement real-time traffic monitoring for dynamic route adjustments.
      Focus on Manhattan and Brooklyn for targeted improvements.


    Mechanical Reliability:

      Conduct a comprehensive audit of BORO TRANS, PRIDE TRANS and other high-incident companies.
      Implement stricter preventative maintenance schedules, especially before Mondays.


    Stakeholder Communication:

      Develop a transparent reporting system for parents and schools.
      Set up a task force involving bus companies, schools, and city officials to address systemic issues.


    Performance Incentives:

      Introduce a performance-based contract system for bus companies.
      Recognize and reward companies and drivers with the best on-time records.



Conclusion:
While the NYC School Bus Service faces significant challenges, the data suggests areas where targeted interventions can lead to substantial improvements. By focusing on reducing delays, enhancing mechanical reliability, and optimizing routes, particularly in high-impact areas, the service can significantly enhance its performance and reliability for New York City's students and families.
